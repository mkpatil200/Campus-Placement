DATASET INFORMATION:

This data set consists of Placement data of students in a campus. It includes secondary and higher secondary school percentage and specialization. It also includes degree specialization, type and Work experience and salary offers to the placed students


PROBLEM STATEMENT:

XYZ University wants to build machine learning model to know whethere student will get placed or not. So that they can provide special attention and help them to get job. Given dataset can be trated as classification or regression problem. In this project, I am going to focus on classification problem, where task is to find whethere candidate will placed or not. This is binary classification problem.


WORKDONE:

1. Libraries Used:
Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, sklearn.

2. Algorithms Used & The Accuracy obtained:
KNN [K Nearest Neighbour]
Logistic Regression
SVM [Support Vector Machine]
Decision Tree
Random Forest


BEST ACCURACY: 91%
